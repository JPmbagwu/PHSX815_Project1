The -h or â€”help flag can be used to print the options when calling any of the executables from the command line. 

# Example usage

* matplotlib (python)

The python file D`DiceAnalysis.py` can be run from the command line by typing:

`<> python DiceAnalysis.py`

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy` and `Matplotlib` also installed.
